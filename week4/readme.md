# Week4 Assignment: 8 Puzzle
## Specification
Here is the programming assignment [specification](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/8puzzle.html) that describes the assignment requirements.

Be sure that your code conforms to the prescribed APIs: each program must be in the "default" package (i.e., no package statements) and include only the public methods and constructors specified (extra private methods are fine). Note that algs4.jar uses a "named" package, so you must use an import statement to access a class in algs4.jar.

## Checklist
The [checklist](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/8puzzle.html) contains frequently asked questions and hints. If you're not sure where to start, see the section at the end of the checklist.

## Testing
The file [8puzzle-testing.zip](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/testing/8puzzle-testing.zip) contains sample data files that you can use to test Board.java and Solver.java.

## Web Submission
Submit a zip file named 8puzzle.zip that contains only the two source files, Board.java and Solver.java.

## Assessment Report
See the [Assessment Guide](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/resources/R2mre) for details on how to interpret the assessment report.
