Specification
Here is the programming assignment [specification](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/collinear.html) that describes the assignment requirements.

Be sure that your code conforms to the prescribed APIs: each program must be in the "default" package (i.e., no package statements) and include only the public methods and constructors specified (extra private methods are fine). Note that algs4.jar uses a "named" package, so you must use an import statement to access a class in algs4.jar.

Checklist
The [checklist](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/checklists/collinear.html) contains frequently asked questions and hints. If you're not sure where to start, see the section at the end of the checklist.

Testing
The file [collinear-testing.zip](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/testing/collinear-testing.zip) contains sample data files that you can use to test Brute.java and Fast.java.

Web Submission
Submit a zip file named collinear.zip that contains only the three source files Point.java, BruteCollinearPoints.java, and FastCollinearPoints.java.

Assessment Report
See the [Assessment Guide](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/resources/R2mre) for details on how to interpret the assessment report.
